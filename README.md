# ICON Service Base

ICON Service Base is a git repository that contains code shared among all Icon services in a service-oriented architecture. The repository consists of a backend written in Python and a frontend written in TypeScript.


## Installation
### Python

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your system. The dependencies of this package are handled with [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). You can install the `icon_service_base` like so:

```bash
poetry add https://gitlab.phys.ethz.ch/tiqi-projects/qchub/icon-services/icon_service_base
```

### TypeScript frontend
Make sure you have Node.js and npm or yarn installed on your system. You can install `@icon-service/icon_service_base` like so:

```bash
npm install https://gitlab.phys.ethz.ch/tiqi-projects/qchub/icon-services/icon_service_base
```

## Usage
### Python
The Python code can be used as a library in other ICON services. Import the relevant modules and classes from the `icon_service_base` package in your Python code, as needed.
### TypeScript Frontend
The frontend code contains the core of the typescript openAPI clients generated by [`openapi-typescript-codegen`](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen/tree/master). This needs to be imported in the ICON services like so:

```ts
import { OpenAPI } from '@icon-service/icon_service_base';
import { request as __request } from '@icon-service/icon_service_base';
export { ApiError } from "@icon-service/icon_service_base";
export { CancelablePromise, CancelError } from '@icon-service/icon_service_base';
export type { OpenAPIConfig } from '@icon-service/icon_service_base';
```
